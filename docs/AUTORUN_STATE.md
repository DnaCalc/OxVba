# AutoRun State

Mode: AutoRun
Intent: Continue implementing OxVBA against `MACH1000_PLAN.md` until project completion, using repeated build/test/docs/commit/push cycles.
Rule: The end of any cycle means continue immediately into the next cycle; do not pause for checkpoint-style stops.

Current checkpoint:
- Phase 12 conformance/stabilization gate now targets declared profile scope `mvp-perf-stabilization-v21`.
- Evidence artifacts are tracked under `docs/evidence/profiles/v21/`, `docs/evidence/formal/`, and `docs/evidence/divergences/`.

Resume protocol:
1. Read this file.
2. Run `./scripts/meta-check.ps1 -Fast`.
3. Continue from `MACH1000_PLAN.md` sequencing section.
