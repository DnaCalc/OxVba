# Production HIR Lowering Evidence

Date: 2026-06-01
Bead: `bd-aprs.9.5`
Workset: `docs/worksets/WORKSET_2026-05-31_FRONTEND_TOKENIZER_PARSER_BINDER_AST_REFACTOR.md`

## Outcome

Added `crates/oxvba-compiler/src/frontend_hir_lowering.rs`, a scoped production HIR lowering path.
For the currently supported HIR surface, source is parsed and bound into typed HIR, lowered from HIR
facts into the current bound module shape, then passed through the existing typecheck, optimizer, and
bytecode/metadata emitter. This means the frontend-v2 syntax bridge now tries real HIR production
lowering before falling back to the older CST/legacy bridge.

The initial production scope is intentionally narrow and explicit:

- procedure declarations,
- local and parameter frame slots with declared scalar/object types,
- explicit `ByVal` / `ByRef` parameter mechanism projection for lowered procedures,
- `Dim` metadata line projection,
- implicit/explicit `Let` and `Set` assignments,
- literals, names, unary expressions, and binary arithmetic/comparison/logical expressions, and
- typed structural `Null`/`Nothing` literals,
- same-module procedure call statements whose targets bind to procedure symbols and whose arguments
  lower through the supported expression surface.

Unsupported constructs are rejected from the HIR production path before lowering and continue through
the tracked fallback path. This prevents silent partial lowering for member/index/new expressions,
control flow, error handling, `ReDim`, `With`, events, declarations, and other surfaces not yet
implemented in HIR production lowering.

## Reopened Continuation

The second FE-8.5 slice removes the procedure-call syntax residual that the route audit exposed
after the hidden CST bridge fallback was removed:

- `CallStmt` lowers into a HIR expression statement instead of falling through recursive statement
  collection.
- `CallExpr` and parser-shaped `IndexExpr` call forms lower into `HirExprKind::Call`.
- HIR production lowering emits `BoundStmt::Call` for same-module procedure targets.
- Lowered procedure parameters now preserve explicit `ByVal` / `ByRef` source mechanisms, so call
  descriptors no longer report `ByVal` parameters as omitted/default `ByRef`.

This is still not FE-8.5 closure. The seed corpus now pins
`conformance/tests/call_coercion_mixed_variant_to_long.bas` as the remaining FE-8.5 bug row:
frontend v2 reaches HIR production, but bytecode and metadata still drift from legacy for the
call/coercion case. That residual must be removed or explicitly justified by behavior evidence
before `bd-aprs.9.5` can close.

## Checks

- `cargo test -p oxvba-compiler frontend_hir_lowering --quiet`
- `cargo test -p oxvba-compiler frontend_diff_v2_smoke_matches_legacy_for_supported_assignment --quiet`
- `cargo test -p oxvba-compiler frontend_diff --quiet`
- `cargo test -p oxvba-compiler syntax_bridge --quiet`
- `cargo test -p oxvba-compiler --quiet`
- `cargo check -p oxvba-compiler`
- `cargo fmt --check -p oxvba-compiler`
- `git diff --check`

## Fresh-Eyes Review

- This bead does not remove the fallback bridge; FE-9 default-route and audit beads must decide which
  construct families are flipped and which residuals remain tracked.
- Call-site descriptors, object/member bindings, and writebacks remain out of the initial HIR
  production scope beyond the simple same-module call route above. Broader argument binding,
  optional/default, ParamArray, member dispatch, and writeback semantics remain open FE-8.5/FE-7
  delivery work.
- The first attempt let HIR production lowering silently ignore call statements. The production guard
  now rejects unsupported syntax kinds up front, and call statements are covered by direct HIR
  lowering tests so scoped HIR lowering is not allowed to compile a partial program.
- The simple assignment parity check initially exposed metadata drift in assignment intent and
  declaration line numbers; HIR lowering now preserves implicit assignment intent and projects local
  declaration source lines into procedure metadata.
- A corpus bookkeeping error briefly attached the known FE-8.5 bug rationale to
  `examples/basic/arithmetic.bas`. The corpus test now asserts that the single bug row is
  `conformance_call_coercion_mixed_variant_to_long`, so equivalent arithmetic cannot mask a
  call/coercion residual.
